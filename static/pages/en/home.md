## Hello ðŸ™Œ

Iâ€™m realbro, **an indie programmer.**  
I previously worked as a software developer for 2.5 years at [Voyagerx Inc.](https://vrew.ai/en/), an AI startup based in South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·.

These days, Iâ€™m focused on creating small programs and diving into books and writing [articles](https://blog.realbro.dev/en/posts). I have a particular interest in exploring human misjudgments and decision-making.

If youâ€™d like to learn more or get in touch, [feel free to reach out!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinhyung-noh-097a19227/)
